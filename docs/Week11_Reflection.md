Concept Connections: Which Week 1–10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?
I wouldn't say I have a overly strong skill set in any week so far. I just keep plugging along and doing the best I can for whefe I am at.

Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?
My challenges are going to be more of writing the actual code for everything.
Remembering how to work with the API key I set up up earlier in Pathways.
